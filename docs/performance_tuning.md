# Healthcare Cost Navigator - Performance Tuning Guide

## Overview

This document describes the performance optimizations implemented to reduce SQL query execution time from ~12 seconds to ~2 seconds for complex aggregation queries like "most expensive procedures by state".

## Performance Bottleneck Analysis

Original query performance breakdown:
- **SQL execution**: 9,400ms (74%)
- **GPT explanation**: 2,000ms (16%) 
- **GPT structured parsing**: 800ms (6%)
- **Misc (embeddings, network)**: 350ms (4%)

**Target**: Optimize the SQL execution phase for maximum impact.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Composite Covering Index

**File**: `alembic/versions/2955a6172c4e_*.py`

```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_pp_state_drg_cost_inc
ON provider_procedures (drg_code, provider_id)
INCLUDE (average_covered_charges);
```

**Impact**: Enables index-only scans, eliminating heap lookups for the most common query pattern.

### 2. Denormalized Provider State

**Files**: 
- `alembic/versions/2955a6172c4e_*.py`
- `etl/init.sql`

```sql
ALTER TABLE provider_procedures ADD COLUMN provider_state CHAR(2);
```

**Impact**: Eliminates the expensive 3-table JOIN by storing state directly in provider_procedures.

**Maintenance**: Automatic trigger keeps data synchronized:
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER provider_state_sync_trigger
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OF provider_id
ON provider_procedures
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION trg_sync_provider_state();
```

### 3. Materialized View for Ultra-Fast Queries

**File**: `alembic/versions/624858ae931f_*.py`

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_state_drg_avg_cost AS
SELECT 
    pp.provider_state,
    d.drg_code,
    d.drg_description,
    AVG(pp.average_covered_charges) AS avg_cost,
    COUNT(*) AS provider_count,
    MIN(pp.average_covered_charges) AS min_cost,
    MAX(pp.average_covered_charges) AS max_cost
FROM provider_procedures pp
JOIN drg_procedures d ON pp.drg_code = d.drg_code
WHERE pp.provider_state IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY pp.provider_state, d.drg_code, d.drg_description;
```

**Impact**: Sub-5ms queries for state-level procedure cost lookups.

**Refresh**: Run `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_state_drg_avg_cost;` after ETL loads.

### 4. PostgreSQL Performance Configuration

**File**: `docker-compose.yaml`

```yaml
environment:
  POSTGRES_SHARED_BUFFERS: 512MB          # Cache frequently accessed data
  POSTGRES_WORK_MEM: 32MB                 # Memory for sorting/grouping
  POSTGRES_EFFECTIVE_CACHE_SIZE: 1GB      # OS cache estimate
  POSTGRES_MAX_PARALLEL_WORKERS_PER_GATHER: 2  # Parallel query execution
  POSTGRES_MAINTENANCE_WORK_MEM: 256MB    # Index creation/maintenance
  POSTGRES_JIT: "on"                      # Just-in-time compilation
  POSTGRES_RANDOM_PAGE_COST: 1.1          # SSD optimization
  POSTGRES_EFFECTIVE_IO_CONCURRENCY: 200  # Concurrent I/O operations
```

**Impact**: Optimizes PostgreSQL for the container environment and workload.

## Query Optimization Strategies

### For New Queries

1. **Use the denormalized columns** when possible:
   ```sql
   -- FAST: Use provider_state directly
   WHERE pp.provider_state = 'CA'
   
   -- SLOW: Avoid joining to providers table
   WHERE p.provider_state = 'CA'
   ```

2. **Leverage the materialized view** for state-level aggregations:
   ```sql
   -- ULTRA-FAST: Use pre-computed aggregates
   SELECT * FROM mv_state_drg_avg_cost 
   WHERE provider_state = 'CA' 
   ORDER BY avg_cost DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

3. **Use covering indexes** by including frequently selected columns:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_example ON table (filter_col, join_col) 
   INCLUDE (selected_col1, selected_col2);
   ```

## Performance Monitoring

### Query Performance Analysis

```sql
-- Check if queries are using indexes
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) 
SELECT d.drg_code, d.drg_description, AVG(pp.average_covered_charges) 
FROM drg_procedures d
JOIN provider_procedures pp ON d.drg_code = pp.drg_code
WHERE pp.provider_state = 'CA'
GROUP BY d.drg_code, d.drg_description
ORDER BY AVG(pp.average_covered_charges) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Look for**: "Index Only Scan" and "Index Scan" instead of "Seq Scan"

### Index Usage Statistics

```sql
-- Monitor index usage
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE tablename = 'provider_procedures'
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
```

## Expected Performance Results

| Component | Before (ms) | After (ms) | Improvement |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| SQL (hot cache) | 9,400 | 180 | 52x faster |
| SQL (materialized view) | 9,400 | 5 | 1,880x faster |
| GPT explanation | 2,000 | 1,050 | 1.9x faster |
| **Total (with index)** | **12,500** | **2,200** | **5.7x faster** |
| **Total (with mat. view)** | **12,500** | **1,100** | **11x faster** |

## Deployment Instructions

### For Existing Databases

1. **Apply migrations**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

2. **Restart with new Docker settings**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

### For Fresh Installs

The optimizations are included in `etl/init.sql` and will be applied automatically.

### Materialized View Refresh Schedule

Add to cron or ETL pipeline:
```bash
# Refresh after data loads (use CONCURRENTLY for zero downtime)
docker exec healthcare_postgres psql -U postgres -d healthcare_cost_navigator \
  -c "REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_state_drg_avg_cost;"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Migration fails**: Ensure database is running and accessible
2. **Index creation slow**: This is normal for `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` - it's non-blocking
3. **Materialized view empty**: Run refresh after data is loaded

### Performance Regression

If performance degrades:
1. Check if indexes are being used: `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
2. Verify PostgreSQL settings: `SHOW shared_buffers;`
3. Check materialized view freshness: `SELECT * FROM mv_state_drg_avg_cost LIMIT 1;`

## Future Optimizations

1. **Partitioning**: For very large datasets, consider partitioning by state
2. **Read replicas**: For high-concurrency read workloads
3. **Connection pooling**: pgBouncer for connection management
4. **Query caching**: Redis for frequently accessed results

**Note**: These optimizations maintain full backward compatibility. All existing queries will continue to work while benefiting from improved performance.
